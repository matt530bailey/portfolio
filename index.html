            For the last two years I have been bartending, and I could not have enjoyed it more. I feel like i have truly found a passion. The money isn't so bad either. However, the amount of time I have to invest on a weekly basis is not sustainable in the long run. I have tried my hand at a lot of professions over the years and I can confidently say that I have found something that will allow me to have the lifestyle I have always wanted, which entailes the ability to travel. I am origanally from Yuba City, CA; born and raised there. For the last three years I have been living in Santa Barbara, CA. my first two years in Santa Barbara I was living in a car, than a van. First out of necessiy, then out of lifestyle. It became a lifestyle I was quite fond of. I currently manage at bar here in SB, as well as help out at three other locations. On top of that I run a cocktail blog that has taken a bit of a life of its own. It focuses on the history behind cocktails, spirits, and the bartenders past and present who helped curate them. <br>Cheers!!
